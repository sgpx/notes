# word alignment

CPU always reads data in fixed size chunks according to architecture

if data is not aligned into words, it can take more than one cycle to read the data

if word size is 8 bytes and data is also aligned into 8 bytes, you only need to read one chunk

if word size is 8 bytes and data is not aligned into 8 bytes, you need to read two chunks
