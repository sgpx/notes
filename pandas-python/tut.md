Pandas is an open-source Python library that provides flexible and powerful data structures. One of these structures is the Pandas DataFrame, which is ideally built for data manipulation and analysis.

Getting Started:

Before we begin, you need to install the pandas library. Run the following command in your terminal:

```Python
pip install pandas
```

After installation, import the pandas library as follows:

```Python
import pandas as pd
```

What is a DataFrame?

Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional, labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. Think of it like a spreadsheet or an SQL table. It's the most commonly used pandas object.

Creating a DataFrame:

You can create a DataFrame from lists, dictionaries, and other DataFrame(s):
 
1. From Lists:

Here's how to create a DataFrame from lists.

```Python
data = [['Alex', 10], ['Bob', 12], ['Clarke', 13]]
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Name', 'Age'])
print(df)
```

2. From Dictionaries:

To create a DataFrame from dictionaries, use the following syntax:

```Python
data = {'Name':['Tom', 'Nick', 'John'],'Age':[20,21,19]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

3. From another DataFrame:

```Python
data = {'A' : pd.Series([1, 2, 3]), 'B' : pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4])}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

DataFrame Operations:

1. Adding a row:

You can add rows to a DataFrame using the append function.

```Python
new_row = pd.Series(['Steve',22], index=['Name', 'Age'])
df = df.append(new_row, ignore_index=True)
```

2. Adding a column:

To add a new column to the DataFrame, just assign it to the DataFrame as follows:

```Python
df['Height'] = [70, 72, 68, 65]
```

3. Deleting a row:

```Python
df = df.drop(3)
```

4. Deleting a column:

```Python
df = df.drop(columns='Height')
```

5. Indexing:

You can index in DataFrame in multiple ways such as loc[], iloc[], and ix[].

```Python
df.loc[0] # Access row at index 0
df.iloc[0] # Access first row
```

6. Filtering:

Filtering can be done as follows:

```Python
new_df = df[df['Age'] > 20]
```

Conclusion:

We covered the basics of creating, manipulating, and accessing data in DataFrame. You can also perform operations like group by, join etc. The possibilities with pandas DataFrame are vast, and the simplicity it brings to data manipulation and analysis makes it a go-to option for Data Scientists and Analysts.

Further learnings could involve dealing with missing values, merging and concatenating DataFrame, applying functions, plotting data, etc.

Data Manipulation Using DataFrame:

Data in a DataFrame can be manipulated in several ways. Let's cover a few:

1. Group By:

Pandas DataFrame allows you to split the data into groups based on criteria. It involves three steps: splitting the data, applying a function, and combining the results. This process is termed as split-apply-combine.

```Python
df.groupby('Name').mean()
```

2. Join:

Join operation could be equated as a SQL join. It merges two dataframes based on a key.

```Python
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='Key')
```

3. Melt:

Pandas ‘melt’ operation performs an unpivoting of the dataframe from a wide format to long format.

```Python
pd.melt(df, id_vars=['Name'], value_vars=['Age'])
```

Handling Missing data:

Pandas provide a suite of methods to handle missing data.

1. Check for missing values:

```Python
df.isnull()
```

2. Drop missing values:

```Python
df.dropna()
```

3. Fill missing values:

```Python
df.fillna(0)
```

4. Forward fill:

```Python
df.ffill()
```

5. Backward fill:

```Python
df.bfill()
```

Plotting With DataFrame:

DataFrames allow you to write expressive syntax to visualize the data. Here is an example of creating a bar plot.

```Python
df.plot.bar()
```

DataFrame allows many other plots, including histograms, line plots, scatter plots, etc.

Applying Functions:

DataFrame's 'apply' function allows to perform a function row-wise or column-wise.

```Python
df['Age'].apply(lambda x: x*2)
```

In summary, pandas provide diverse functionalities for data manipulation and analysis. These functions help analyze and prepare the data for Machine Learning tasks or simple data analysis tasks. The pandas library, along with Matplotlib and Scikit-learn, provides a comprehensive set of tools to manage the complete data science pipeline.

Advanced Concepts:

After getting comfortable with the fundamental pandas operations, it's time to explore some of the more advanced features of pandas.

1. Multi-Indexing:

In pandas, Multi-Indexing refers to creating multiple levels of indexing, which allows the users to store and manipulate the data efficiently with a lower-dimensional data structure.

```Python
arrays = [['bar', 'bar', 'baz', 'baz', 'foo', 'foo', 'qux', 'qux'],
          ['one', 'two', 'one', 'two', 'one', 'two', 'one', 'two']]
index = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays(arrays, names=['first', 'second'])
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(8, 2), index=index)
```

2. Pivot Tables:

Pivot tables are one of the most powerful features of pandas. They allow you to aggregate and reorder data efficiently.

```Python
table = pd.pivot_table(df, values ='D', index =['A', 'B'], 
               columns =['C'], aggfunc = np.sum, fill_value=0)
```

3. Crosstab:

Crosstabs are used to get an initial feel of the data. You can find the frequency of categories in the data.

```Python
pd.crosstab(df.A, df.B)
```

Reshaping and Resizing DataFrame:

DataFrame provides a set of methods for reshaping the data.

1. Reshaping:

In pandas, the reshape function is used to reshape the dataframe. It’s a way to rotate from columns to rows.

```Python
df.unstack()
```

```Python
df.stack()
```

2. Resize:

In pandas, the resize function is used to resize the dataframe.

```Python
df.resize((3,2))
```

Categorical Data:

Pandas provides tools for working with categorical data. Converting categorical data to numerical data is a common operation.

```Python
df["gender"] = df["gender"].astype('category')
df["gender_cat"] = df["gender"].cat.codes
```

Time Series:

Pandas was developed in the context of financial modeling, supporting both regular time-series data and irregular data is inherently integrated.

```Python
rng = pd.date_range('1/1/2012', periods=100, freq='S')
ts = pd.Series(np.random.randint(0, 500, len(rng)), index=rng)
```

Text Data:

Pandas provides a set of string functions which make it easy to operate on string data.

```Python
df['column'].str.lower()
```

Importing/Exporting data:

Pandas supports different formats to import/export data.

```Python 
df.to_csv('filename.csv')
```

```Python 
df = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')
```

Moving forward, you can explore advanced concepts like Testing, Comparison with SQL, Enhancing Performance, etc. Data Analysis with pandas is a continuously learning journey, and through experience, you will be able to understand the flexibility and power it provides. Bonus: Always refer to the official pandas documentation, it’s a 'pandas' treasure.

Pandas provides several ways to enhance the computational performance of your dataframe operations.

1. Cython Optimizations:

Cython is a programming language that is a superset of Python. It provides C-like performance with a syntax similar to Python. Pandas utilizes Cython to enhance the performance of computation-intensive operations.

```Python
pd.options.compute.use_bottleneck = False
```

2. Using categoricals:

When you have a small number of unique values relative to the size of your dataset, converting to categorical data type can save memory and improve performance.

```Python
df['column'] = df['column'].astype('category')
```

3. Using eval() for compound expressions:

Pandas provides an eval() function that allows you to perform operations in a single step rather than multiple steps, which can enhance your performance.

```Python
df.eval('B = A + C', inplace=True)
```

Testing Pandas Code:

Testing is an important part of software development process, and pandas provides several functions that can be used for testing your code.

1. Testing equality of two data frames:

```Python
pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(df1, df2)
```

2. Testing equality of two series:

```Python
pd.testing.assert_series_equal(series1, series2)
```

Comparison of Pandas with SQL:

Pandas is often compared to SQL because both can be used for data manipulation and analysis. However, Pandas is more flexible and provides more functionalities as compared to SQL.

1. Selecting data:

In SQL we use the SELECT query to fetch data. The equivalent operation in pandas would be using square brackets [] or dot operator . to select a column or a number of columns.

```Python
df['column_name']
df.column_name
```

2. Filtering:

In SQL we use the WHERE clause to filter rows. The equivalent in pandas would be to use boolean indexing.

```Python
df[df['column_name'] == value]
```

3. Grouping and Aggregating:

In SQL we use the GROUP BY and a subsequent aggregation function to group rows and apply an aggregate function. The equivalent in pandas would be to use the groupby() method and an aggregate function such as sum() or mean().

```Python
df.groupby('column_name').sum()
```

Critical Concepts in Pandas:

Lastly, there are numerous advanced concepts in pandas that are vital to master when dealing with complex data manipulation and analysis scenarios.

1. Hierarchical indexing:

Hierarchical indexing in pandas allows you to have index on an index (multiple index), it is an important feature of pandas that separates it from many other data manipulation libraries and makes it extremely convenient and efficient for handling and visualizing higher dimensional data.

2. Panel data:

Pandas provides a Panel object for three-dimensional data. It is less used and people prefer MultiIndex with DataFrame, as they are more flexible and intuitive.

3. IntervalIndex:

Pandas provides IntervalIndex for storing interval ranges. Its efficient memory representation allows you to save space when dealing with intervals.

```Python
pd.IntervalIndex.from_breaks([0, 1, 2, 3])
```

Sometimes, you might have to work with larger datasets, the size of which could exceed your system's memory. This is where capabilities like chunking can help in intelligently reading and working with a subset of the data at any given time.

1. Reading in Chunks:

Pandas' read_csv function allows you to chunk your input:

```Python
chunksize = 5
chunks = []
for chunk in pd.read_csv("filename.csv", chunksize=chunksize):
    # process your data
    chunks.append(your_processing_function(chunk))

# Concatenate the chunks into single DataFrame
df = pd.concat(chunks)
```

2. Writing into Chunks:

When writing a large DataFrame to a CSV file, you can break the data into chunks:

```Python
chunksize = 5
for i in range(0, df.shape[0], chunksize):
    df[i:i+chunksize].to_csv("filename.csv", mode="a", header=False)
```

Performance Tuning:

There are other performance-enhancing practices that can be adopted.

1. Avoid Chaining:

In pandas, data filtering and operations can be performed in a way that object referencing follows a chain. But chained operations can be slower and unreliable, as they might return copies instead of views on a DataFrame.

```Python
# Avoid
df[df['A'] > 2]['B'] = new_values
# Instead Do
df.loc[df['A'] > 2, 'B'] = new_values
```

2. Using Vectorized operations:

Vectorized operations perform computations over complete arrays. They are inherently faster than traditional loop constructs.

```Python
# Avoid
new_column = []
for value in df['column']:
    new_column.append(value * 2)
df['new_column'] = new_column

# Instead Do
df['new_column'] = df['column'] * 2
```

3. Method Chaining:

Method chaining can simplify your code and can also provide performance benefits because it allows pandas to optimize operations. You can chain methods to perform multiple operations in a single expression.

```Python
# Avoid
df = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')
df = df.dropna()
df = df.set_index('column')

# Instead Do
df = (pd.read_csv('filename.csv')
        .dropna()
        .set_index('column'))
```

---

4. Using Categorical Data:

If a column in your DataFrame contains only a small number of unique values compared to its size, you could convert it to a categorical type. This would not only save memory but also speed up operations like groupby().

```Python
df['column'] = df['column'].astype('category')
```

5. Memory Usage Optimization:

You can save a lot of memory by changing the data types of your columns to more efficient ones. For instance, changing a float64 column containing integer values to int32 would save roughly 50% memory.

```Python
df['column'] = df['column'].astype('int32')
```

Data Cleaning using Pandas:

Data cleaning is an important part of any data analysis project. Pandas makes data cleaning, and filtration easy. Below are some operations related to data cleaning.

1. Dropping Duplicate Values:

Pandas drop_duplicates method helps in removing duplicates from the data frame.

```Python
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
```

2. Replacing Values:

Values can be replaced with other values dynamically.

```Python
df.replace([old_value1, old_value2], [new_value1, new_value2])
```

3. Renaming Columns:

If the column names are not user friendly, you can rename them using the rename() function.

```Python
df.rename(columns={'old_name': 'new_name'})
```
