# android dev

# activity

- class in android sdk
- entry point into app
- manages user interaction

# layout

- set of ui objects
- defines objects position on screen
- made up of XML
- object that appears onscreen

# android project

- contains files that constitute an application

# activity_main.xml

- layout file
- layout file name for corresponding activity class beings with activity_ and ends with class name like activity_foobar.xml for FoobarActivity.kt

# XML element to Java view conversion

happens here in MainActivity.kt `setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)`

# `R`

R.java is an autogenerated file created by AAPT (Android Asset Packaging Tool) that contains resource IDs for all the resources of res/ directory.

# onCreate(Bundle?)

called when an instance of activity is created

when an activity instance is made it needs a UI for it to manage

setContentView inflates layout XML and converts it to objects to put onscreen

when a layout is inflated each view inside it is converted to an `View` object and instantiated according to layout attributes

MainActivity uses LayoutInflater class to instantiate each of the view objects defined in layout

# Snackbar

```
import com.google.android.material.snackbar.Snackbar

// ...

val x = Snackbar.make(this, someViewObject, "foo", Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG)
x.show()
```
